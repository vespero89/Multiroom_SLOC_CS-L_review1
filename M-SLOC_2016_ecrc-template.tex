\begin{abstract}
In the field of human speech capturing systems, a fundamental role is played by the source localization algorithms. In this paper a Speaker Localization algorithm (SLOC) based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is evaluated and compared with state-of-the art approaches. The speaker position in the room under analysis is directly determined by the DNN, leading the proposed algorithm to be fully data-driven. Two different neural network architectures are investigated: the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). GCC-PHAT (Generalized Cross Correlation Phase Transform) Patterns, computed from the audio signals captured by the microphone  are used as input features for the DNN.  
In particular, a multi-room case study is dealt with, where the acoustic scene of each room is influenced by sounds emitted in the other rooms.
The algorithm is tested by means of the home recorded DIRHA dataset, characterized by multiple wall and ceiling microphone signals for each room. In detail, the focus goes to speaker localization task in two distinct neighbouring rooms.%%

As term of comparison, two algorithms proposed in literature for the addressed applicative context are evaluated,  the Crosspower Spectrum Phase Speaker Localization (CSP-SLOC) and the Steered Response Power using the Phase Transform speaker localization (SRP-SLOC).
Besides providing an extensive analysis of the proposed method, the article shows how DNN-based algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches evaluated on the DIRHA dataset, providing an average localization error, expressed in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), equal to 330\,mm and 390\,mm respectively for the Simulated and the Real subsets.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Events localization is continuously performed by living beings through brain elaboration of clues provided by the sensitive organs. Research on automatic systems for estimating the position in space of an object has a long history \cite{malioutov2005sparse}. One of the first localization algorithms is the radar, which had an important role during the last World War, and it is fundamental in nowadays travelling. Similarly, the sonar system relies on the propagation of sound waves and it is employed in submarines and in fishery.

In the recent years, a special effort has been spent for acoustic source localization \cite{Dibiase2001Robust}, since it has a fundamental role in several applications, such as the study of binaural or monaural models for reproducing the human hearing system \cite{stern-et-al-2006,willert2006probabilistic,saxena2009learning}, the cocktail party problem \cite{roman2003speech, zotkin2004accelerated}, interaction between human and robots \cite{trifa2007real,li2013sound,dashuman2016human} and home assisted living \cite{asaei2009verified,Morales-cordovilla14roomlocalization,principi2015integrated}. This work focuses on the last research field, being the automated tracking of individuals inside a building an important component of any general purpose speech capture system.  This scenario is particularly challenging since it requires dealing with reverberation, overlapping speech, and background noise.

\textcolor{red}{In particular, this work addresses the task of localizing multiple and possibly moving speakers inside a home equipped with several microphones for each room. The algorithm is based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and it is able to efficiently use simultaneously the signals coming from the rooms of the building. The following section provides a review of the recent literature on the topic.}

\subsection{Related Works}
\textcolor{red}{The challenges of localizing speakers in multi-room scenarios explain why this task has been devoted  particular attention in the last years.}  For example, in \cite{Rodomagoulakis2017} the authors developed a multi-room spoken command recognizer, while in \cite{ijcnn-vad,vesperini2016deep,Giannoulis2015,Katsamanis2014} voice activity detectors able to concurrently identify the location in time and the room of origin of speech segments have been proposed. In a previous work by the authors \cite{vesperini2016sloc}, a multi-room speaker localization algorithm based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been presented.

Typical approaches for retrieving the source of an acoustic event in realistic environments rely on algorithms based on the 
sound propagation fundamentals. Indeed, considering a microphone array, a sound wave reaches the microphones in different temporal instants, which are observable as phase shifts in the captured signals.  A review of state-of-the-art localization algorithms is presented in \cite{kundu2014acoustic}. In general, the main categories in which the algorithms can be grouped are: steered beamformer based locators, high resolution spectral estimation based locators and TDOA-based locators. The latter technique consists in the estimation of the time difference of arrival (TDOA) from the Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC) spectrum of the signals; successively, from TDOAs, the hyperbolic curves representing the signal direction of arrival (DOA) are determined. However, this method is subject to a severe performance degradation in noisy and reverberant conditions \cite{champagne1996performance}. In \cite{tsiami2014experiments}, the authors present a method exploiting the crosspower spectrum phase and relying on the GCC computation. In this case, advancements are obtained with the help of additional de-reverberation techniques.

A more robust algorithm for low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) scenarios is based on the Global Coherence Field (GCF), also known as Steered-Response Power (SRP) \cite{brandstein1997robust}. It is a one-stage method where the cost function represents the probability that a given point in space is the source point of the signal \cite{brutti2007classification}. The algorithm cannot operate in real-time due to its high computational burden related to the high number of local maxima in the SRP space \cite{yook2016fast}. For this reason, many strategies to optimize the global-maximum research have been proposed \cite{DoSY07,Minotto2012,Lee2016}. In particular, in \cite{DoSY07} the authors use the stochastic region contraction (SRC) to decrease the computational cost. The authors in \cite{transfeld2015acoustic} investigated a framework  suitable for acoustic event localization with a microphone array in far-field context, where a combination of GCC-PHAse Transform (GCC-PHAT) and SRP-PHAse Transform (SRP-PHAT) methods is employed. The resulting spatial likelihood function is spatially filtered and smoothed, significantly outperforming the reference algorithm, by means of an onset event detection technique. 

The aforementioned algorithms require a specific and accurate tuning of their system parameters, which leads to a lack of generality for the system itself. Alternatively, data-driven approaches are able to extract key features from the input signal independently from the setting of application. In sight of this, neural networks can tackle these problems as they provide an \textit{expert system} able to work with a minimal human involvement. 

The use of neural networks for speaker localization has been initially investigated in 1991 \cite{zakarauskas1991artificial}, but the obtained results were not suitable for real world application due to the computational limitations of that time. The approach employed two feedforward artificial neural networks composed of one hidden layer to determine the position (width and depth) of an acoustic source in a waveguide.  In a later work \cite{datum1996artificial}, a three-layer Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) is trained according to the multiple extended Kalman algorithm, with the purpose of estimating the direction of arrival of a sound source captured by two directional and spatially separated receivers. In \cite{Mumolo200369} and similarly in \cite{murray2011neural}, an MLP model following a spectral analysis step (i.e., based on GCC spectrum or pinna related transfer function) is used for a talker-following robot, which required the elevation and the direction of the source speaker. The search for a balance between computational complexity and the neural network design has been always an issue to be addressed in these tasks, in particular in the past years when the computing power was limited.  A pruning algorithm for the neural architecture based on compressive sampling theory exploited for speaker localization is presented in \cite{dehkordi2011compressive}, with the aim to speed up the convergence of a neural network with a sparse structure. 


%The effectiveness of a speaker localization algorithm in a multi-room scenario is affected by the characteristics of the environment itself, which introduces difficulties such as reverberation time, background noise and the occurrence of overlapping events. These issues severely deteriorate the algorithm performance, since they affect all microphones placed in different rooms. 




To the best of our knowledge, few studies recently investigated speaker localization algorithms based on DNN, and, a part from a previous work by the authors \cite{vesperini2016sloc}, none of them addressed the multi-room scenario. In \cite{xiao2015learning}, the authors proposed a robust DOA estimation in a single room by means of an MLP and features based on the GCC-PHAT, and demonstrated the efficiency against a large amount of simulated noisy and reverberant audio inputs. In \cite{Takeda2016a,Takeda2016b}, the authors presented two speaker localization algorithms for autonomous robots. In \cite{Takeda2016a}, the algorithm operates in the frequency domain, and it employs features of the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm \cite{Schmidt86}. In \cite{Takeda2016b}, the proposed algorithm is extended to locate multiple sound sources. It is worth pointing out that additionally to being addressed to robots, the methods presented in \cite{Takeda2016a,Takeda2016b} provide discrete speaker positions as output.

The main contribution of this work is the development of a completely data-driven approach for Speaker Localization (SLOC) in a multi-room environment, considering both the moving and the stationary conditions. %}
%%%
The purpose of the data-driven strategy is to avoid a dedicated fine-tuning of parameters, which is typical and highly specific for the state of the art algorithms.
In details, the proposed algorithm is composed of a feature extraction stage and an artificial neural network, composing together the DNN-SLOC. %\textcolor{red}{
The feature extraction stage calculates GCC-PHAT Patterns \cite{xiao2015learning} from pairs of microphone signals, and two different neural networks architectures are evaluated for estimating the speakers' position. The first network, denoted as MLP-SLOC, is composed of fully connected layers with rectified linear units (ReLU) \cite{nair2010rectified}. The second network, denoted as CNN-SLOC, is composed of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers with ReLUs. The motivation behind the use of convolutional layers resides in their ability to capture the intrinsic structure of GCC-PHAT Pattern matrices \cite{xiao2015learning}, which is lost by using fully connected layers only. Additionally, two different algorithm architectures are evaluated: in the first, localization in a room is performed by using only the signals acquired with the microphones present in that room. The second architecture uses the signals acquired with the microphones of all rooms. In the experiments, we investigated which combination of microphones yielded the best performance, as well as the importance of using a temporal context.
%Additionally to investigating different network architectures, the concurrent processing of one or more room audio data, the dependence on the microphone position and the importance of a temporal context are also investigated.

Although diverse examples can be found in the literature on indoor acoustic source localization, rare are the cases that consider a multi-room environment. Among these, the work by Tsiami \textit{et al.} \cite{tsiami2014experiments} proposes an algorithm based on Crosspower Spectrum Phase Speaker Localization (CSP-SLOC). 
%Differently from a previous work by the authors \cite{vesperini2016sloc}, here the approach is extended by investigating the CNN architecture and the influence of the temporal context. 
In a previous work by the authors \cite{vesperini2016sloc} a preliminary evaluation was conducted employing the MLP neural network: here the approach is extended by investigating the CNN architecture and the influence of the temporal context. Additionally, in \cite{vesperini2016sloc} localization is performed by using a separate network for each room that processes only the microphone signals coming from that room. In this work, we evaluate this architecture and we propose a new architecture that uses the microphone signals coming from all the rooms. Finally, the performance is compared with a further state of the art approach (SRP-PHAT \cite{DoSY07}), and evaluated both in the Simulated and Real subset of the DIRHA corpus \cite{cristoforetti2014dirha}, demonstrating remarkable performance improvements in location accuracy for both the cases of study.

 %TODO: STRESS THIS

The outline of the paper is as follows. A general description of the speaker localization algorithm is given in  \secref{sec:ALGO}, while the comparative methods are shown in \secref{sec:comp_meth}. Dataset details are provided in \secref{sec:dataset}. In \secref{sec:expRes} experimental setup is described and obtained results are discussed.
Finally, \secref{sec:concl} concludes the manuscript.

\section{Proposed Method}\label{sec:ALGO}
The proposed multi-room speaker localization algorithm is composed of a features extraction stage and an artificial neural network (ANN). \textcolor{red}{In a preliminary stage, a multi-room VAD \cite{ferronineural,vesperini2016deep} extracts the speech portions of the signals and identifies the room where the speakers are located. Here, the multi-room VAD is supposed ideal, and the development of an algorithm able to perform both tasks simultaneously will be addressed in future works.} The first stage extracts GCC-PHAT Patterns features from each input frame by using pairs of microphone signals. Successively, the feature matrices related to adjacent frames are joined in a chunk  with the purpose of exploiting the temporal correlation of the data. \textcolor{red}{Hence, the artificial neural network is trained on labeled data to estimate the Cartesian coordinates $\left ( \chi,\psi \right )$, i.e., the position of the speaker inside the target room, with the origin of the coordinates system located in the upper left corner of a room. The target positions are originally expressed in millimeters and they are then scaled in the range $[0,1]$ for training and testing. In order to ensure that only valid predictions are produced, the final coordinate is calculated as $\tilde{x} =\max(0, \min(1, x))$, where $x$ can represent the abscissa $\chi$ or the ordinate $\psi$. Finally, the output is unscaled to obtain the coordinate in millimeters.} A block diagram of the algorithm based on a CNN is shown in \figref{fig:proposed_method}.
%%%
In the multi-room scenario, speakers positions are estimated by means of a feature extraction stage and a neural network per room. Two different architectures have been investigated in this contribution: in the first, each neural network is dedicated to processing the audio signals coming from a room and it estimates the position of the speaker in that room. This architecture will be denoted as 1Rx1N-SLOC in the following. In the second architecture, the neural network jointly processes audio coming from different rooms, while estimating the speaker position only in one room. This architecture will be denoted as $K$Rx1N-SLOC in the following, where $K$ denotes the number of rooms. \figref{fig:2Rx1R} shows the differences between the two architectures in the two rooms case study ($K=2$). %(\textbf{ndemap: la figura non mostra le differenze tra 2Rx1R e 1Rx1R: cambiare frase o (meglio) inserire figura 1Rx1R}).

\subsection{Features based on GCC-PHAT Patterns}
\label{sec:features}

Processing several pairs of audio signals allows to identify the direction from which the signal arrives to the sensors, also called direction-of-arrival. By exploiting this information, it is possible to obtain the position of the speaker in a room. 

Due to sound wave propagation, a delay $\tau$ is expected between the source and a generic microphone. Considering two different microphones $a$ and $b$, it is possible to estimate the time difference $\Delta\tau_{ab} = \tau_a -\tau_b$ by using the Crosspower Spectrum Phase - Coherence Measure (CSPCM) \cite{knapp1976generalized}. %(\textbf{ndemap: non e' chiaro cosa c'entri la CSPCM con quello che viene scritto dopo}). 
%The computation of the GCC-PHAT is used in the TDOA estimation:
This method has the GCC-PHAT computation as a starting point:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CSPCM}
C_{ab}(n,\tau) =  \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\frac{S_a(f,n) S_b^*(f,n)}{|S_a(f,n)| |S_b(f,n)|} \cdot e^{j2 \pi f \tau} df },
\end{equation}
where $S_a(f,n)$ is the Short-Time Fourier Transform of the frame $n$ of the signal $s_a(t)$ coming from a generic microphone. The TDOA is estimated as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta\tau_{ab} = \underset{\tau}{\arg \max}\, C_{ab}(n,\tau).
\end{equation}
Successively, it is possible to calculate the DOA of the sound event for each microphone pair. 

In good acoustic conditions, with low reverberation time and sufficiently high SNR, this method gives an adequate DOA estimation \cite{zhang2008Phat}.
Nevertheless, due the numerous reflective surfaces and the variety of noises present in a multi-room domestic scenario these conditions are usually not satisfied.

Regarding to the proposed approach, preliminary experiments demonstrated that the simple TDOA estimation is not sufficiently reliable as input feature, thus we make use of GCC-PHAT Patterns, which have been previously employed in \cite{xiao2015learning}.
%Therefore the use GCC-Patterns compared to the TDOAs is more reliable and contains all the information required for the localization, so they are used as input features for the Neural Network \cite{xiao2015learning}. 

GCC-PHAT Patterns are calculated by using only microphone pairs belonging to the same array. Here, we suppose that the maximum distance $d_{max}$ between two sensors is equal to  50\,cm and that the sample rate $f_s$ is equal to 16\,kHz. Thus, the maximum time delay (in samples) between 2 microphones is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TOA}
\Delta\tau_{max} = \frac{d_{max}}{\nu} \cdot f_s \approx 24,
\end{equation} 
where $\nu=340$\,m/s is the sound speed.
Hence, the GCC-PHAT Patterns are extracted as follows: for each considered microphone pair the CSPCM is computed with a \textcolor{red}{frame size of 30\,ms and a hop size of 10\,ms respectively equal to 480 samples and 160 samples at the sample rate of 16\,kHz.} %ndFAB
Under such conditions, only the central $2\Delta\tau_{max} + 1$ CSPCM values contain useful information. Thus, the first 50 values of $C_{ab}(n,\tau)$ are selected to compose the GCC-PHAT Pattern $\mathbf{x}_{ab}[n]$. 
Finally, the vectors originated by the different considered microphone pairs are standardized to have zero mean and unitary standard deviation.
Formally: 
\begin{align}
\mathbf{x}_{ab}[n] = & \;  [C_{ab}(n,0)\,C_{ab}(n,1) \cdots C_{ab}(n,49)]^T,\\
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{ab}[n] =  & \;  \frac{\mathbf{x}_{ab}[n] - \mu}{\sigma}, \label{eq:gcc_pattern}
\end{align}
where $\mu$ is the mean value of $\mathbf{x}_{ab}$, $\sigma$ the standard deviation, and $T$ denotes the transpose operation.

Successively, all possible combinations for each array are considered. In particular, the feature matrix related to the array $i$ composed of $N^{(i)}$ microphones assumes the following form:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{X}^{(i)}[n] =   \begin{bmatrix} \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{12}^{(i)}[n] \\ \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{13}^{(i)}[n] \\ \vdots\\ \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1N^{(i)}}^{(i)}[n] \\ \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{23}^{(i)}[n] \\\vdots \\ \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{2N^{(i)}}^{(i)}[n] \\ \vdots \\  \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{(N^{(i)}-1)N^{(i)}}^{(i)}[n] \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Finally, considering all the $M$ arrays located in the environment, the input matrix $\mathbf{X}[n]$ is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fx_matrix}
\mathbf{X}[n] =   \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{X}^{(1)}[n] \\ \mathbf{X}^{(2)}[n] \\ \vdots\\ \mathbf{X}^{(M)}[n] \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
An example of $\mathbf{X}[n]$ is shown in \figref{fig:GCC-PATT}, where colors represent the amplitude of $C_{ab}(n,\tau)$, and orange tones denote the lowest values and blue tones the highest values in the range of $\tau$ considered. In the exposed case, the matrix $\mathbf{X}[n]$ is composed of 10 GCC-PHAT Patterns, belonging to a subset of the possible pairs originated from a circular ceiling array. It is possible to note that the maximum arrival time difference is equal to 9 samples (corresponding to about 0.2\,s), observed in the GCC-PHAT Pattern of the fourth microphone pair.

	\label{fig:GCC-PATT}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Temporal Context}\label{sec:TEE}
The temporal context consists in the frames of the signal adjacent to the one being processed. In order to exploit this information, the input of the neural network  is augmented with $(C-1)/2$ GCC-PHAT Patterns preceding and following the current GCC-PHAT Pattern matrix $\mathbf{X}[n]$. The network, thus, estimates the speaker position by employing a \textit{chunk} of feature matrices defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{\mathbf{X}}}[n]= \left [ \begin{array}{c} 
\mathbf{X}[n -  \frac{C-1}{2} \cdot s]\\
\vdots\\
\mathbf{X}[n - s]\\
\mathbf{X}[n]\\
\mathbf{X}[n+s]\\
\vdots\\
\mathbf{X}[n + \frac{C-1}{2} \cdot s]
\end{array}
\right ],
\end{equation}
where $C$ is the total length of the chunk, and $s$ denotes the stride, which defines the temporal extension of the chunk. \figref{fig:cxt_str} shows an example with $s=2$.

In cases where the selected frames do not contain speech, the GCC-PHAT Patterns matrices related to the first or the last frame of the segment are replicated accordingly.

\subsection{Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network}
\label{sec:MLP}
The first neural network architecture we investigate in this paper is the MLP \cite{Rumelhart86-LRB}. Indeed, it is well known that an  MLP with one or more hidden layers and a sufficient number of non-linear units (neurons) can  approximate any continuous  function  on  a  compact  input  domain  with arbitrary precision. For this reason, MLPs are said to be universal function approximators \cite{hornik1989multilayer}. A single neuron can be formally described as:
\begin{equation}
g(\mathbf{u}[n])=\varphi \left(\left(\begin{matrix} \sum _{ j=1 }^{ D }{w_j u_j[n] }  \end{matrix} \right) + b\right),
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the size of input data $\mathbf{u}[n]$, the bias $b$ is an externally applied term and $\varphi(\cdot)$ is the non-linear activation function. In this case we employ the ReLUs \cite{nair2010rectified}, defined as $\varphi(x) = \text{max}(0,x)$.
Thus, the mathematical description of a one-hidden-layer MLP is a function $f:\mathbb{R}^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^L$, where $L$ is the size of the output vector, so:

\begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{u}[n]) = 	\varphi \left( b_2 + W_2 \left( \varphi \left( b_1 + W_2 \cdot \mathbf{u}[n]\right) \right) \right),
\end{equation}
where $W_i$ and $b_{i}$ are the respective synaptic weights and the biases of the $i$-th layer.
The  behavior  of  this architecture  is  parametrized  by  the connection weights, which are adapted during the supervised network training, accomplished by using the Adam algorithm \cite{kingma2014adam} for the stochastic gradient-based optimization and a feature wise batch normalization \cite{ioffe2015batch}.

In the feature extraction block the GCC-PHAT Patterns are arranged in 2-D or 3-D matrices, whilst the MLP accepts input data as frame-by-frame vectors. To fed the this neural network, the matrices are flattened in a vector and the input layer consists of a number of units equal to $C\cdot M$.


\subsection{Convolutional Neural Network}
\label{sec:CNN}
The birth of this kind of feed-forward neural network is related to image processing \cite{lawrence1997face}. Indeed, neural networks as MLPs take vectors as input, while this condition is not satisfied in the image case. The problem is tackled by means of convolutional layers, whose aim is to process restricted a area of a 2-D input, similarly to what happens in the animal visual cortex.
% Inspired by the animal visual cortex, CNN employs convolutional layers elaborating restricted area of a 2-D input. 
As in that case, the whole input matrix is processed by repeated application of a function across its sub-regions, obtaining so-called \textit{feature maps}. Practically, this is implemented by a convolution of the input data with a linear filter, adding a bias term and then applying a non-linear function.

Denoting the $m$-th feature map at a given $i$-layer as $h_{m,i}$, the $m$-th filter or \textit{kernel} is determined by the weights $W_{m,i}$ and bias $b_{m,i}$, thus:

\begin{equation}
h_{m,i}=\varphi	\left((W_{m,i} \ast \mathbf{u}_j[n]) + b_{m,i} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\ast$ represent the convolution operation.
The different feature maps obtained from each kernel of a convolutional layer are then summed to compose 
the input data for the following layer.

Commonly, a kernel layer is coupled with a pooling layer in order to assess more robustness against patterns shifts in the processed data. The CNN structure is completed by an MLP layer, whose task is to produce the network response - \textcolor{red}{\textbf{the estimated $\left \langle \chi,\psi \right \rangle \left [mm\right ]$ positions in this case.}} %ndFAB

Although this architecture was designed for image processing, several works in the literature have employed CNNs in the audio field \cite{thomas2014analyzing,mcloughlin2015low}. In this work, we exploit a 3-D arrangement of the input data (as described in \secref{sec:TEE}), %(\textbf{ndemap: dove?})),
inspired by what occurs in image processing with RGB channels. Thus, the CNN-SLOC is able to efficiently process adjacent frames and to exploit the temporal evolution of the audio signal \cite{wirn2016-vad}. Up to the authors' knowledge, employing CNNs for indoor speaker localization are not present in the scientific literature.

According to that, the network first convolutional layer could respectively have 2-D or 3-D kernels: when a context size $C > 1$ is considered, the input features are organized in a 3-D tensor where the third axis represents the temporal index (as shown in \figref{fig:cxt_str}). In the degenerate case where $C$ is equal to 1, the tensor reduces to a bi-dimensional matrix.


\section{Comparative Methods}
\label{sec:comp_meth}
The proposed localization algorithm has been compared with two state-of-the art methods described in the remainder of this section.

\subsection{Crosspower Spectrum Phase Speaker Localization}
\label{sec:soa_met}
The first algorithm taken as reference is the Crosspower Spectrum Phase speaker localization algorithm (CSP-SLOC) \cite{tsiami2014experiments}. It is composed of two consecutive steps and due its structure, the algorithm is evaluated per one room at time.  First of all, considering a 2-D plane and a set of microphone pairs, for each pair the DOA angle ($\theta$) is estimated by means of the TDOA computed from $C_{ab}(t,\tau)$ \eqref{eq:CSPCM}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \cos \theta}{\nu} = \Delta\tau_{ab}  \Rightarrow \theta = \cos^{-1}  \left( \frac{\nu \Delta\tau_{ab} }{d} \right), 
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the distance between the microphones.

After that, Least Mean Square is applied for the generic point $\mathbf{p}= \left \langle \chi,\psi \right \rangle $, with the purpose of minimizing the error defined as the sum of the squared distances $D_j(\mathbf{p})$ between $\mathbf{p}$ and the $j$-th DOA:
\begin{equation}
E(\mathbf{p}) = \sum_{j=1}^M D^2_j (\mathbf{p}),
\end{equation}
for all the $M$ DOAs.

Several physical aspects affect the accuracy of the CSP-SLOC, such as the orientation of the speaker, the noise level and reverberation.

In order to increase CSP-SLOC performances, the authors in \cite{tsiami2014experiments} involved a pre-processing cepstral filtering technique provided in \cite{stephenne1997new}. In details, we employed for the cepstral dereverberation algorithm no-overlapping frames of 2048 samples, to which is applied an exponential window with scaling factor $\alpha = 0.9985$ and averaging weighting coefficient $\mu=10^{-4}$. To be coherent with the proposed method, we computed the TDOAs with a rate of 100 frames/second and a frame overlap equal to 66\%.


\subsection{Steered Response Power Using the Phase Transform}
Another state of the art algorithm has been considered for comparison purpose. It consists in a modification of the Steered Response Power (SRP) method, based on the stochastic region contraction (SRC) approach, as described in \cite{DoSY07}. SRC avoids the complete fine grid-search, by applying an iterative process that progressively contracts the search volume for local maxima, thus reducing the overall computational cost.

As first step, a delay-and-sum beamformer is steered in the considered volume for each $n$-th frame of length $T$, leading to the SRP function for the spatial vector $\mathbf{s}$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SRP}
P_n(\mathbf{s}) \equiv \int_{nT}^{(n+1)T} \left| \sum_{a=1}^M w_a s_a (t -\tau (\mathbf{s},a))\right|^2 dt,
\end{equation}
where $s_a(t)$ is the signal from a generic microphone $a$, $w_a$ its weight, $\tau (\mathbf{s},a)$ the distance in the time domain between $\mathbf{s}$ and that microphone. Practically, \eqref{eq:SRP} is evaluated in the frequency domain, scaled by the phase transform weighting factor (PHAT). The SRC is iteratively applied: $J_0 = 5000$ points are randomly evaluated, $N_0 = 20$ points maximizing \eqref{eq:SRP} are selected and the search volume is restricted to a smaller region that contains the $N_0$ points.
In the following, this algorithm will be referred as SRP-SLOC.



\section{The DIRHA Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/plan}
	\caption{The map of the apartment used for the DIRHA project (a). Figures (b) and (c) show the considered rooms, with the disposition of their relative microphones. }
	\label{fig:DIRHA_map}
\end{figure}

The analysis of the DNN-SLOC performance has been conducted on the DIRHA dataset \cite{cristoforetti2014dirha}, characterized by diverse scenes, rooms, microphones and noise conditions\footnote{\url{http://dirha.fbk.eu/simcorpora}}. In details, the apartment where the dataset has been recorded consists in five rooms and a total of 40 microphones. These are arranged in linear and circular arrays, with the first ones placed on the walls of all rooms, and the circular ones are placed on the ceiling of the living room and of the kitchen (\figref{fig:DIRHA_map}).

The dataset is composed of two subsets, named \emph{Simulated} and \emph{Real}. For each of them several \textit{scenes} have been recorded, composed of typical situations observable in a domestic context. As reported in \tableref{tab:dataset}, the two subsets differ in terms of scenes and total length: in the Simulated set the scenes length is fixed to 60 seconds, while it varies in the Real set. In addition, the latter has been recorded with persons moving in the rooms and speaking towards different directions throughout the scenes, whilst the Simulated has been obtained by convolving a fixed set of measured Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) with recorded signals.
The Simulated subset is also characterized by a lower SNR compared to the Real one and overlapping speech does not occur.

Our study focuses on two rooms of the dataset, i.e.,  the Kitchen and the Living Room, due to three main aspects. First of all, these rooms consist in the area of a home-environment where most of the events take place. In addition, being the widest rooms of the apartment, the localization task is more challenging. Finally, the number of microphones are higher compared to the other rooms, and it comprises both wall and ceiling arrays.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:expRes}
In this section the experimental procedure is presented and the obtained results are discussed. 

\subsection{Experimental setup}
The performance of the two proposed methods, 1Rx1N-SLOC and 2Rx1N-SLOC described in \secref{sec:ALGO}, are investigated in the two DIRHA subsets.
Both architectures have been evaluated by using MLP and CNN. The experiments have been performed by assuming the presence of an Oracle multi-room Voice Activity Detector (VAD), which selects only the speech portions of the audio signals.

The experiments have been conducted by means of a $k$-fold cross-validation technique in order to reduce the performance variance, and an early-stopping training strategy has been employed to prevent overfitting. In the \textit{Simulated} dataset $k$ is equal to 10, thus 64-8-8 scenes respectively compose the training, validation and test sets. In the \textit{Real} dataset, due to the total absence of speech in some scenes, only 11 of them were suitable for each room. Thus, a leave-2-out cross validation has been adopted, where 7 scenes compose the training set, 2 the validation set and 2 the test set.

The selection of the most performing DNN-SLOC architecture has been carried out by means of a four-stage optimization strategy, described as follow:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{Network Size Selection.}}  It consists in varying the network layout while keeping fixed the input signals (i.e., 4 microphone pairs for the Kitchen and 5 microphone pairs for the Living Room). 
	Concerning the MLP architecture, 30 different network topologies have been investigated, composed of 1, 2 or 3 hidden layers with 4, 8, \dots, 1024 units. 
	On the contrary, in the case of CNN architecture a higher number of parameters must be considered, which have been reported in \tableref{tab:CNNs} for the sake of conciseness. 
	\item{\textbf{GCC-PHAT Patterns Selection.}} \textcolor{red}{The objective of this stage is to find the composition of the feature matrix $\mathbf{X}[n]$ defined in \eqref{eq:fx_matrix} that provides the best localization performance. The procedure is performed separately for each room and it starts by considering the circular arrays on the ceilings: each array is composed of 6 microphones, thus, excluding the central one, the number of microphone pairs is 10 and the size of the initial feature matrix is $10 \times 50$. This matrix is then augmented by gradually including the GCC-PHAT Patterns $\mathbf{\tilde{x}}_{ab}[n]$ (see \eqref{eq:gcc_pattern}) related to the pairs of microphones of the remaining arrays of the room. If the inclusion of the GCC-PHAT Pattern results in a performance improvement, it is retained, otherwise it is discarded.}
	
%	This stage aims to find the most performing GCC-PHAT Patterns matrix $\mathbf{X}[n]$ between a subset of the available $\mathbf{X}^{(i)}[n]$ microphone combinations belonging to different arrays.
%	The starting point was the circular array placed on the room ceilings, which is composed of $N = 6$ microphones. Excluding the central one, it leads to 10 possible pairs. Then, combinations of signal pairs $\mathbf{\tilde{x}}_{ab}^{(i)}[n]$ coming from the wall arrays have been gradually added to the ceiling array signals with a sequential forward selection strategy, in order to arrange the evaluated $\mathbf{X}[n]$.
	%TODO cf. punto 6e) modifiche al testo
	\item{\textbf{Network Size Selection.}} Another network size selection is then performed, having as input features the set of GCC-PHAT Patterns providing the best results in the previous step. 
	\item{\textbf{Temporal Context Selection.}} Here the objective is evaluating the effects of the temporal context, by varying the strides values, i.e. $s=\{1,3,4,5\}$, and the context dimensions, i.e. $C=\{3,7,11,13,15,17,19,21\}$.

The localization accuracy has been evaluated in terms of averaged Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):
\begin{equation}
\text{RMSE} = \frac{\sqrt{(\chi-\chi_{\text{ref}})^2 + (\psi-\psi_{\text{ref}})^2}}{N_{TOT}},
\end{equation}
where $\chi$ and $\psi$  are the network outputs, $\chi_{\text{ref}}$ and $\psi_{\text{ref}}$ are the reference Cartesian coordinates, and $N_{TOT}$ is the total number of frames, \textcolor{red}{{as reported in \tableref{tab:N_TOT}. }}
In addition, the performance has been evaluated in terms of $P_{cor} = N_{FINE}/N_{TOT}$, where $N_{FINE}$ is the 
number of frames with RMSE less than 500\,mm. 
%%ndFAB
Similarly to a classification task, $P_{cor}$ provides a measure of the localization accuracy, since the estimated positions with an RMSE less than 500\,mm are considered correct decisions. \textcolor{red}{The performance metrics and the related hyperparameters have been chosen according to the guidelines of the Speech Activity detection and Speaker LOcalization in DOMestic environments (SASLODOM 2014)\footnote{http://dirha.fbk.eu/SASLODOM2014} task of the EVALITA 2014 challenge \cite{basili2014proceedings}.} These two metrics are averaged over all the available network outputs.

\subsubsection{Evaluation without the temporal context}
The results obtained by the different addressed algorithms in the Simulated case study are reported in \tableref{tab:results_SIMU}, both with and without the temporal context (i.e., respectively at the end of the third and the fourth optimization stage).

Focusing on the performance obtained without temporal context, the best DNN configuration is the 2Rx1N MLP-SLOC. In particular, both int the 1Rx1N and  2Rx1N configurations, the MLP performs slightly better than the CNN. 
Furthermore, even if only little improvement is observable in terms of RMSE for the 2Rx1N case, the advantage of this setting lies in the statistical behavior, as reported in \figref{fig:boxplot_simu-mlp}. 
The boxplots show in terms of mean and standard deviation a narrow dispersion of results for both the CNN and MLP architectures.
%Indeed, by using the audio from both rooms reduces the dependence on the microphones location inside the room.
%ndFAB results discussion 6a) 
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Indeed, by using the audio from both rooms reduces the dependence on the microphones location inside the room as it is proved by a reduced area between the mean plus variance and mean less variance values. In particular, in the case of the MLP there is also an absolute reduction of the error by comparing the minimum and maximum values of the RMSE.}}

In details, the best MLP layouts for the Kitchen and Living room are two single layer networks of 256 and 1024 units, respectively. %As concerns the CNN-SLOC, the two best layouts are composed of a single convolutional layer of 48 kernels of size 5$\times$5 with no pooling, followed by a two layers MLP with  512, 512 units and 128, 256 units respectively for Kitchen and Living Room.
With regards to the CNN-SLOC, the two best layouts are the following: for the Kitchen, a single convolutional layer of 48 kernels of size 5$\times$5 with no pooling, followed by two feed-forward layers with 512, 512 units, while for Livingroom, a single convolutional layer of 24 kernels of size 5$\times$5 with no pooling, followed by two feed-forward layers with 256 and 512 units.

The CSP-SLOC and the SRP-SLOC algorithms obtain a lower localization performance compared to the neural network architectures, with an average RMSE respectively equal to 1464\,mm and 981\,mm.

\subsubsection{Evaluation including the temporal context}
The effect of temporal context is considered in the final optimization stage, in which the network size determined after the third stage is kept fixed. %This last stage is compared to the previous in order to highlight the decisive effect of the exploitation of an audio excerpt.  

The best localization performance has been obtained by using the CNN-SLOC having as input the microphone signals coming only from the target room. The resulting averaged RMSE is equal to 333\,mm and the highest $P_{cor}$ is 77\%. The details of the configuration parameters for the best performing setups on the Simulated subset are shown in \tableref{tab:bestCONF_SIMU}. The performance improvement at this stage is evident, whereas the employment of multiple room audio features does not seem to have a beneficial effect for CNN based algorithms. 
%by the variation of the feature set, except as previously said about stability to vary of the input microphones. %(da modificare)

The results obtained at the very end of the optimization procedure show the ability of the CNN architecture to efficiently exploit the contextual information of adjacent frames, with a reduction of 42.2\% of the localization error with respect to the configuration with $(C,s)=(1,1)$, as shown in \figref{fig:cxtCNN-S}. 
The best resulting values of context and strides are $(C,s)=(21,4)$ and $(C,s)=(17,5)$ for Kitchen and Living Room, respectively, which means processing a segment of duration approximatively equal to \textcolor{red}{0.85\,s.}

%The introduction of the temporal context has beneficial effects also with the MLP, but with a lower error reduction (equal to 21.5\%).

In this case the CNN results more effective with respect to the MLP architecture, and it is able to further reduce the RMSE,
%ndFAB Results discussion - 6c)
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{as we can notice from the table \tableref{tab:bestCONF_SIMU}.}}
In particular, the CNN-2Rx1N architecture reduces the RMSE by 37\% with respect to the method proposed in a previous work by the authors \cite{vesperini2016sloc}.
Indeed, the introduction of a temporal context improves the performance also with the MLP architecture, with RMSE reduction equal to 21.5\%.
The  results obtained in the investigation of the audio excerpt are reported in \figref{ctx-str-SIMU}, where the different strides $s$ are plotted while varying the temporal context $C$. %It can be noticed that a similar trend of performance with respect to temporal resolution values is registered.

\subsection{Results on the Real Dataset} 
The main difference between the Real and the Simulated  dataset is the position of the speaker, which is not fixed during the scene. Thus, the speaker moves within the room while pronouncing the sentence. Furthermore, in this dataset overlapping events are not present.

\subsubsection{Evaluation without the temporal context}
\tableref{tab:results_REAL} reports a comparison among the evaluated algorithms with the best results obtained for each configuration. As in \tableref{tab:results_SIMU}, for the DNN-SLOC, both the the performance are reported without temporal context and at the end of the fourth stage, in which performance have been studied investigating the temporal context.

The localization performance obtained by the CSP-SLOC algorithm is quite similar to the one in the Simulated case study, with an average RMSE equal to 1280\,mm. The SRP-PHAT algorithm attains an averaged RMSE equal to 792\,mm. The performance achieved by the comparative methods is significantly superior than the one obtained in the Simulated case study. The motivation is the higher SNR level characterizing the audio files in the Real dataset.

As shown in \figref{fig:boxplot_real-mlp}, in this case the 2Rx1N architecture produces a more significant improvement of performance both for the MLP-SLOC and the CNN-SLOC, and consistently with what observed for the Simulated dataset, the variance with the microphone position decreases.
As result of the third optimization stage, the best performing MLP layout in the 2Rx1N case is composed of a single layer of 16 units  both for the Kitchen and the Living Room. Regarding the CNN-SLOC,  the most performing configuration is composed of a convolutional layer with 24 $5\times5$ kernels without pooling, followed by a two layers MLP with respectively 256, 256 units and 256, 512 units for Kitchen and Living Room.

\subsubsection{Evaluation including the temporal context}

As performed with the Simulated dataset, the effects of the temporal context have been studied after the third optimization stage.  The introduction of the temporal context leads to an average localization accuracy of 387\,mm with the CNN-SLOC for the 2Rx1N configuration. As highlighted in \figref{fig:cxtCNN-R}, the RMSE reduces by 37.2\% for the 1Rx1N configuration and by 37.5\% for the 2Rx1N configuration. In concordance with the results obtained with the Simulated dataset, the MLP architecture benefits from the introduction of the temporal context, with a resulting error reduction of 36\% for the 1Rx1N and of 29\% for the 2Rx1N configuration.


For the CNN-SLOC applied in the Real dataset, the best resulting values of context and strides are $(C,s)=(19,4)$ and $(C,s)=(17,3)$ respectively for Kitchen and Living Room, corresponding to a segment of length about \textcolor{red}{0.76\,s and 0.51\,s.} 


\figref{ctx-str-REAL} reports the RMSE for different context sizes $C$ and strides $s$ in the case of 1Rx1N applied to the Kitchen room.
%It is noticeable the similar trend of the performance while varying the temporal resolution. 
Similarly to the \textit{Simulated} dataset, the variation of the temporal resolution produces a similar performance trend for the two neural architectures. 
Details of the best performing configurations are provided in \tableref{tab:bestCONF_REAL}.

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{sec:concl}

In this paper, a DNN-based approach for single speaker localization in a multi-room domestic environment has been proposed and an extensive evaluation of obtained performance is detailed. The neural network employs GCC-PHAT Patterns as input features, which have been obtained by combining various microphone pairs. Hence, two different neural network architectures have been investigated, the multi layer perceptron (MLP) and the convolutional neural network (CNN). The coordinates of a speaker inside the target room are directly estimated without additional processing, resulting in a fully data-driven approach.
A particular effort has been directed to the evaluation of a spatial and temporal context, revealing the latter to be extremely decisive. 	\textcolor{red}{In details, audio coming from one or two rooms has been jointly exploited (1Rx1N, 2Rx1N), while different numbers of adjacent frames have been concatenated to evaluate the influence of the temporal context.}
%%
The algorithm implicitly requires an Oracle VAD in order to process only human speech. Results are evaluated on the DIRHA Dataset in comparison with two state-of-the-art algorithm, based respectively on Crosspower Spectrum Phase estimation and on Steered Response Power.

In terms of absolute improvement respect to the SRP-PHAT approach, the CNN-SLOC improves the performance by 66\% and 51\% respectively for the Simulated and the Real dataset. With regards to the two evaluated neural network architectures, the CNN with 3-D kernels is able to exploit the temporal context information more efficiently respect to the MLP network both in terms of RMSE and $P_{cor}$.

% As further remark, it is possible to notice that in almost every configuration, obtained at the end of the optimization scheme, which shows to have the lowest RMSE, it also has the highest $P_{cor}$. This means that the proposed algorithm is robust not only in terms of mean error, but also in terms of the number of frames in which a localization error occurs.

The proposed method operates in a complete autonomous way.
Indeed, once trained, the neural network provides the coordinates of the speaker directly from the speech excerpts of the signals captured by the microphone arrays.

%This allows to totally avoid the fine-tuning of parameters being generally needed by state-of-the-art approaches, which depends on the application environment and implicates a lack of generality.
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Differently, a lack of generality is observed in the proposed state-of-the-art approaches. For example, the CSP-SLOC requires the knowledge of the room geometry, in addition, parameters such as iterations and number of searched maxima has been fine-tuned for the SRP-SLOC.}}
%fine-tuning phase needed by the typical approaches on varying of the application environment.

Future works will be oriented on the development of a joint multi-room VAD \cite{ijcnn-vad,ijcnn2016-vad} and SLOC neural network based system, in order to obtain an integrated and fully data-driven algorithm.
Furthermore, different neural networks will be investigated, with a deeper focus on the temporal evolution of the signal by means of a temporal context, such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks \cite{hochreiter1997long}.
